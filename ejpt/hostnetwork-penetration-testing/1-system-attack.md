🗒️ **System or Host based attacks** are attacks targeted towards specific systems oh hosts. They are about *exploiting vulnerabilities within Windows and Linux operating systems*, running on (internal) servers, workstations, laptops, etc.

- During a penetration test, host based attacks are applied after the target network is accessed.
- Focus on exploiting inherent vulnerabilities within the target O.S.
- Understand the target O.S. and its misconfigurations to stage an attack consisting of exploiting vulnerabilities, elevate local privileges, perform password cracking and lateral movement, etc.
